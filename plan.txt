🛒 Supermarket Inventory Workflow
1️⃣ Product Entry (Adding New Stock)
Step 1: Barcode Scanning
•	📌 Scan the product’s barcode using a mobile scanner.
•	🔍 Check if the barcode contains an expiry date (e.g., GS1-128 format).
•	✅ If expiry date is found, save it in the database.
•	❌ If expiry date is not found, proceed to OCR.
Step 2: Use OCR (If Needed)
•	📸 Scan the product package or label using the mobile camera.
•	🧠 Extract expiry date using OCR (Tesseract or API like Google Vision).
•	🔍 Validate format (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/YYYY, etc.).
•	✅ If valid, save the expiry date in the database.
•	❌ If uncertain, prompt the user for manual entry.
Step 3: Manual Entry (If Needed)
•	If both barcode and OCR fail, allow manual entry.
•	User inputs product name, quantity, and expiry date.
•	System validates expiry date before saving.
➡️ The product is now stored in the inventory (products + stock tables).
Step 4: Bulk Entry (For Large Quantity Stocking)
•	User manually enters the product name, total quantity, and expiry date.
•	System processes and saves the entire batch in one step.

2️⃣ Expiry Date Processing Logic
1. Representative Sample Scanning
•	Scan a single item from the pack to capture its product information and expiry date.
•	System recognizes this as part of a multi-pack entry.
2. Quantity Multiplier
•	After scanning the representative item, prompt: "Is this part of a multi-pack?"
•	User enters total quantity (e.g., 40 units).
•	System automatically duplicates the entry with the same expiry date for all items.
3. Batch Assignment
•	All items are assigned the same batch number.
•	System tracks them as being received together.

3️⃣ Sales & Checkout (Removing Items)
Step 1: Scan Product at Checkout
•	The cashier scans the barcode of the product.
•	The system identifies the product and its expiry date (oldest stock first).
Step 2: Reduce Inventory (FIFO - First In, First Out)
•	The system checks stock for the earliest expiry date.
•	✅ If stock is available, reduce quantity from that batch.
•	❌ If that batch is empty, move to the next available batch.
Step 3: Save Sale & Update Inventory
•	Save sale details (product, quantity, date, expiry batch used).
•	If stock falls below the threshold, send a low-stock alert.
